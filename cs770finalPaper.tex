\begin{abstract}
In this paper we describe the formatting requirements for
SIGCHI Conference Proceedings, and this sample file
offers recommendations on writing for the worldwide
SIGCHI readership. Please review this document even if
you have submitted to SIGCHI conferences before, some
format details have changed relative to previous years.

\section{Introduction}

This format is to be used for submissions that are
published in the conference proceedings.  We wish to give
this volume a consistent, high-quality appearance. We
therefore ask that authors follow some simple\cite{Mather2000}
guidelines. In essence, you should format your paper
exactly like this document. The easiest way to do this is
simply to download a template from the conference web
site, and replace the content with your own material.

\section{Methodology}
\section{Findings}

\subsection{Manipulation Check}
We conducted a manipulation check to verify the success manipulation of our condition. After watching each video clip, we ask participants to rate the severity for each scenario. We found in all scenarios, the participants rated the severe condition significantly higher than the non-severe condition.

\begin{table}
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Type & Non-Severe & Severe & p Value \\
    \hline
    Financial & 3.633 & 4.918 & 0.0003 \\
    \hline
    Psychological & 2.633 & 5.020 & $ < 0.0001$ \\
    \hline
    Psychological & 2.816 & 5.020 & $ < 0.0001$ \\
    \hline
  \end{tabular}
  \caption{Mean Difference between perceive severity}
  \label{tab:table1}
\end{table}

\subsection{Result}
To test our hypothesis, we carried analysis of variance (ANOVA) on the collected result. 

In our first hypothesis, we hypothesize that robots will be blamed significantly more than other stakeholders in the psychological harm condition. To verify the hypothesis we ran a one-way ANOVA on the result and found no evidence to support our hypothesize. We found participants blamed programmer the most(mean = 6.28) compare to other stakeholders. In relation to our hypothesis, participants blamed programmers($ F(1,582) =139.1, p < .0001$), owner ($ F(1,582) = 19.68, p < .0001$), manufacturer($F(1,582) = 38.28, p < .0001$) and manager($F(1,582) = 13.38, p = 0.0003$) more than the robot. Only customers were blamed significantly less than the robot($F(1,582) = 54.09, p < .0001$)

\begin{table}[h]
  \centering
  \begin{tabular}{|c|c|c|}
    \hline
    Stakeholders & Mean & Standard Deviation\\
    \hline
    Robot & 3.184 & 0\\
    \hline
    Customer & 1.255 & 0\\
    \hline
    Manager & 4.142 & 0 \\
    \hline
    Manufacturer & 4.806 & 0 \\
    \hline
    Owner & 4.34694 & 0 \\
    \hline
    Programmer & 6.286 & 0 \\
